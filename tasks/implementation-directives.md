# Implementation Directives

## Code Standards

### General Principles
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow SOLID principles and design patterns
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Prioritize security and performance
- Write comprehensive tests for all functionality

### Documentation Requirements
- All public APIs must be documented
- Complex algorithms require inline comments
- README files for each major component
- Architecture decision records (ADRs) for significant changes

### Testing Standards
- Minimum 80% test coverage
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user workflows
- Performance tests for high-traffic features

### Security Guidelines
- Input validation and sanitization
- Proper authentication and authorization
- Secure handling of sensitive data
- Regular security audits and vulnerability scans
- HTTPS/TLS for all communications

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/TASK-XXXX`: Individual feature branches
- `hotfix/`: Critical production fixes
- `release/`: Release preparation branches

### Code Review Process
1. Create pull request with detailed description
2. Assign reviewers based on code ownership
3. Address all review comments
4. Ensure CI/CD pipeline passes
5. Require at least 2 approvals for critical changes

### Deployment Pipeline
1. Automated testing on pull request
2. Staging deployment for integration testing
3. Production deployment after approval
4. Rollback procedures for failed deployments
5. Monitoring and alerting post-deployment

## Quality Assurance

### Code Quality Gates
- Static code analysis passing
- Security scan with no critical issues
- Performance benchmarks met
- All tests passing
- Code coverage above threshold

### Definition of Ready (for development)
- User story clearly defined
- Acceptance criteria documented
- Dependencies identified and resolved
- Design approved by stakeholders
- Technical approach agreed upon

### Definition of Done (for completion)
- All acceptance criteria met
- Code reviewed and approved
- All tests passing
- Documentation updated
- Deployed to production
- Monitoring and alerting configured
