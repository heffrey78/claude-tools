## User Story
As a Claude Code user with many conversations across different projects and topics,
I want to tag and organize my conversations with custom labels and categories,
So that I can quickly find related conversations and better manage my conversation history.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [x] Review existing conversation data structure
- [ ] Analyze current project-based organization
- [ ] Document search and filtering capabilities
- [ ] Identify metadata fields available for tagging
- [ ] Note performance considerations for tag-based queries

### API Documentation Review
- [ ] Conversation metadata structure and extensibility
- [ ] Message content analysis for auto-tagging
- [ ] Project path extraction and categorization
- [ ] Tool usage patterns for automatic tag suggestions
- [ ] Timestamp-based organization strategies

### Technical Research
- [ ] Tag storage strategies (embedded vs external)
- [ ] Tag indexing for fast queries
- [ ] Auto-tagging algorithms (content-based, pattern-based)
- [ ] Tag hierarchies and categorization systems
- [ ] Tag persistence across conversation updates

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Add custom tags to conversations manually
- [ ] Auto-suggest tags based on conversation content
- [ ] Filter conversations by single or multiple tags
- [ ] Create tag hierarchies and categories
- [ ] Bulk tag operations for multiple conversations
- [ ] Tag-based analytics and insights
- [ ] Import/export tag configurations
- [ ] Search conversations by tag combinations
- [ ] Performance: Tag queries return results in <100ms

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Tag data persists across application restarts
- [ ] Tag operations are atomic and don't corrupt data
- [ ] Tag system is extensible for future features
- [ ] Memory efficient tag storage and indexing
- [ ] Intuitive tag management UI in terminal

## Behavioral Specifications

Feature: Conversation Tagging and Organization
  As a user with extensive conversation history
  I want to tag and organize my conversations
  So that I can efficiently categorize and retrieve related conversations

  Background:
    Given I have multiple conversations across different projects
    And I am using claude-tools with tagging capability

  Scenario: Add tags to a conversation
    Given I have a conversation with ID "abc123"
    When I run "claude-tools tag abc123 --add 'rust' 'debugging' 'performance'"
    Then the conversation should be tagged with those labels
    And I should see confirmation of tags added
    And the tags should persist across sessions

  Scenario: Auto-suggest tags based on content
    Given I have a conversation about Rust programming
    When I run "claude-tools tag abc123 --suggest"
    Then I should see suggested tags like "rust", "programming", "cargo"
    And suggestions should be based on conversation content
    And I should be able to accept or reject suggestions

  Scenario: Filter conversations by tags
    Given I have conversations tagged with "rust" and "python"
    When I run "claude-tools list --tags rust"
    Then I should see only conversations tagged with "rust"
    And the results should be sorted by relevance

  Scenario: Combine multiple tag filters
    Given I have conversations with various tag combinations
    When I run "claude-tools list --tags 'rust AND debugging'"
    Then I should see conversations tagged with both "rust" and "debugging"
    And I should support OR, AND, NOT operations

  Scenario: Tag-based analytics
    Given I have conversations with various tags
    When I run "claude-tools stats --by-tags"
    Then I should see analytics grouped by tags
    And I should see tag usage frequency
    And I should see tag combinations and patterns

  Scenario: Bulk tag operations
    Given I have multiple conversations matching a search
    When I run "claude-tools tag --search 'error handling' --add 'debugging'"
    Then all matching conversations should be tagged with "debugging"
    And I should see a summary of conversations modified

  Scenario: Tag hierarchy management
    Given I want to organize tags hierarchically
    When I run "claude-tools tags --create-category 'Languages/Rust'"
    Then I should be able to assign conversations to hierarchical tags
    And I should be able to query by category or specific tags

  Scenario: Interactive tag management
    Given I am in the interactive terminal mode
    When I press 't' on a selected conversation
    Then I should see a tag management interface
    And I should be able to add, remove, or edit tags
    And changes should be applied immediately
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Tag Data Structure and Storage
1. [ ] Design tag data structure and schema
2. [ ] Implement tag storage mechanism (JSON sidecar files)
3. [ ] Create tag indexing for fast queries
4. [ ] Add tag persistence and loading
5. [ ] Create tag validation and sanitization

### Phase 2: Basic Tag Operations
1. [ ] Implement tag addition and removal
2. [ ] Create tag listing and display
3. [ ] Add tag-based conversation filtering
4. [ ] Implement tag search and matching
5. [ ] Create tag management CLI commands

### Phase 3: Auto-tagging and Suggestions
1. [ ] Implement content-based tag suggestions
2. [ ] Add project path-based auto-tagging
3. [ ] Create tool usage pattern recognition
4. [ ] Implement model-based tag suggestions
5. [ ] Add machine learning tag recommendations

### Phase 4: Advanced Tag Features
1. [ ] Implement tag hierarchies and categories
2. [ ] Add bulk tag operations
3. [ ] Create tag-based analytics
4. [ ] Implement tag import/export
5. [ ] Add tag combination queries (AND, OR, NOT)

### Phase 5: Terminal UI Integration
1. [ ] Add tag display in conversation list
2. [ ] Create interactive tag management interface
3. [ ] Implement tag-based filtering in terminal UI
4. [ ] Add tag visualization and navigation
5. [ ] Create tag editing shortcuts and workflows
