**Estimated Effort**: S (1d)

## User Story
As a Claude Code user working across multiple machines,
I want to backup and sync my ~/.claude.json configuration,
So that I can maintain consistent settings and recover from data loss.

## Context & Research

### Configuration Sensitivity
The ~/.claude.json file contains:
- **Sensitive Data**: API keys, user IDs, OAuth tokens
- **Machine-Specific Paths**: Project absolute paths
- **Personal History**: Conversation prompts and content
- **Usage Metrics**: Costs and token usage

### Backup Requirements
- Secure handling of sensitive data
- Path normalization for cross-machine compatibility
- Selective sync (exclude history/metrics if desired)
- Version management for configuration changes

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Create timestamped backups of ~/.claude.json
- [ ] Restore from backup with validation
- [ ] Export sanitized configuration (no secrets)
- [ ] Import configuration with path translation
- [ ] Selective backup/restore (projects, MCP servers, etc.)
- [ ] Diff configurations to see changes
- [ ] Automated backup on changes
- [ ] Interactive UI: Backup management interface

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data in backups
- [ ] Compress large backup files
- [ ] Validate configuration integrity
- [ ] Handle path differences across systems

## Behavioral Specifications

```gherkin
Feature: Configuration Backup and Sync
  As a Claude Code user
  I want to backup my configuration
  So that I can restore it if needed

  Scenario: Create configuration backup
    Given I have a configured ~/.claude.json
    When I run "claude-tools config backup"
    Then a timestamped backup should be created
    And sensitive data should be encrypted

  Scenario: Restore from backup
    Given I have a backup file
    When I run "claude-tools config restore backup-2025-01-21.json"
    Then my configuration should be restored
    And paths should be adjusted for my system

  Scenario: Export sanitized config
    Given I want to share my configuration
    When I run "claude-tools config export --no-secrets"
    Then an export should be created
    And it should not contain API keys or tokens

  Scenario: Sync specific sections
    Given I only want to sync MCP servers
    When I run "claude-tools config sync --only mcp-servers"
    Then only MCP server configs should be synced
    And other settings should remain unchanged
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backup System
1. [ ] Create backup/restore functionality
2. [ ] Implement encryption for sensitive data
3. [ ] Add compression for large files
4. [ ] Create backup validation

### Phase 2: Sync Features
1. [ ] Implement selective import/export
2. [ ] Add path translation logic
3. [ ] Create configuration diff tool
4. [ ] Add merge functionality

### Phase 3: Automation
1. [ ] Add auto-backup on changes
2. [ ] Create backup rotation
3. [ ] Implement cloud sync (optional)
4. [ ] Add UI backup management

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Secure handling of sensitive data
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility
- [ ] Reliable backup/restore
- [ ] Clear documentation
