# TASK-0018-00-00: In-Conversation Text Search and Navigation

**Status**: [ ] Not Started | [ ] In Progress | [ ] Blocked | [X] Complete | [ ] Abandoned
**Created**: 2025-06-22
**Updated**: 2025-06-22
**Assignee**: Claude Tools Development Team
**Priority**: P1 (High)
**Parent Task**: Phase 3 - Enhanced User Experience
**Dependencies**: TASK-0012-00-00 (Advanced Search - completed)
**Estimated Effort**: M (3-5 days)
**Related Requirement**: REQ-0011-FUNC-00

## User Story
As a Claude Tools user reviewing a long conversation,
I want to search for specific text within that conversation and navigate between matches,
So that I can quickly locate relevant information without manually scrolling through hundreds of messages.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [x] Global search functionality exists and works well across conversations
- [x] Advanced search with boolean queries, regex, and filtering is complete
- [x] Interactive UI has conversation detail view with full message display
- [x] CLI `show` command displays full conversation content in various formats
- [ ] No in-conversation search capability exists
- [ ] Users must manually scroll/search through conversation content

### User Experience Gap
The current search system is excellent for finding conversations, but once a user has identified the right conversation, they need a way to search within it. This is especially important for:
- Long conversations with 50+ messages
- Technical discussions with code snippets
- Troubleshooting sessions with multiple solutions
- Reference conversations with specific commands or configurations

### Technical Requirements
- Integration with existing UI state management
- Real-time search performance for large conversations
- Visual highlighting system that doesn't conflict with syntax highlighting
- Keyboard navigation that works in both CLI and TUI contexts
- Search state management and cleanup

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut ('/' or 'Ctrl+F') activates in-conversation search mode
- [ ] Search input appears with real-time highlighting as user types
- [ ] Navigation between matches using 'n' (next) and 'N' (previous) keys
- [ ] Support for both plain text and regex patterns
- [ ] Visual highlighting distinguishable from global search highlighting
- [ ] Works in both CLI `show` command and interactive UI detail view

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Search highlighting updates in <100ms for conversations with 1000+ messages
- [ ] Real-time highlighting without performance degradation
- [ ] Efficient memory usage for large conversation content

### User Experience Requirements
- [ ] Clear indication of current match position (e.g., 'Match 3 of 7')
- [ ] Escape key or 'q' clears search and returns to normal view
- [ ] Search state properly resets when switching conversations
- [ ] Visual feedback for no matches found
- [ ] Search highlights visible in both light and dark terminal themes

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Integration with existing conversation display components
- [ ] Search state management in App struct
- [ ] Keyboard event handling for search mode
- [ ] Search highlighting without interfering with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Proper cleanup and state reset mechanisms

## Behavioral Specifications

Feature: In-Conversation Text Search and Navigation
  As a user viewing a long conversation
  I want to search within the conversation content
  So that I can quickly find specific messages or information

  Background:
    Given I have opened a conversation in detail view
    And the conversation contains multiple messages with various content

  Scenario: Activate in-conversation search
    Given I am viewing a conversation in detail mode
    When I press '/' or 'Ctrl+F'
    Then a search input should appear at the bottom of the screen
    And I should be able to type a search query
    And the cursor should be in the search input field

  Scenario: Real-time search highlighting
    Given I have activated in-conversation search
    When I type "function" in the search input
    Then all instances of "function" should be highlighted in the conversation
    And highlighting should update in real-time as I type
    And I should see "Match 1 of 5" or similar position indicator

  Scenario: Navigate between search matches
    Given I have performed a search with multiple matches
    When I press 'n' (next)
    Then the view should scroll to the next match
    And the current match should be visually distinct from other matches
    When I press 'N' (previous)
    Then the view should scroll to the previous match

  Scenario: Regex pattern search
    Given I have activated in-conversation search
    When I type "regex:async.*function" in the search input
    Then all text matching the regex pattern should be highlighted
    And navigation between matches should work normally

  Scenario: No matches found
    Given I have activated in-conversation search
    When I type "xyz123nonexistent" in the search input
    Then I should see "No matches found" message
    And no highlighting should be visible in the conversation

  Scenario: Clear search and return to normal view
    Given I have an active search with highlighted matches
    When I press Escape or 'q'
    Then the search input should disappear
    And all search highlighting should be removed
    And I should return to normal conversation viewing mode

  Scenario: Search in CLI show command
    Given I am using the CLI show command to view a conversation
    When I activate search (implementation varies for CLI)
    Then search functionality should work similarly to interactive mode
    And highlighting should be visible in terminal output

  Scenario: Performance with large conversations
    Given I am viewing a conversation with 1000+ messages
    When I perform a search that matches text across many messages
    Then highlighting should appear within 100ms
    And scrolling and navigation should remain responsive
    And memory usage should not significantly increase

  Scenario: Search state management
    Given I have an active search in conversation A
    When I switch to view conversation B
    Then the search state should be cleared
    And conversation B should display normally without search artifacts
    When I return to conversation A
    Then search should be inactive and conversation should display normally
```

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met and verified
- [ ] In-conversation search works in both CLI and interactive modes
- [ ] Performance requirements satisfied (<100ms search response)
- [ ] Visual highlighting is clear and non-conflicting
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works smoothly between matches
- [ ] Search state properly managed and cleaned up
- [ ] All tests passing with >80% coverage
- [ ] Documentation updated with new functionality
- [ ] User experience is intuitive and responsive

## Notes
This task builds directly on the completed advanced search functionality (TASK-0012) and leverages the existing conversation display infrastructure. The focus is on providing a smooth, fast, and intuitive in-conversation search experience that complements the global search capabilities.

The implementation should prioritize performance and user experience, ensuring that search feels instantaneous even for very long conversations. The visual design should be consistent with the existing UI while providing clear distinction between different types of highlighting.
