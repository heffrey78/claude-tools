## User Story
As a Claude Code user managing MCP servers,
I want to view, edit, and validate MCP server configurations through both CLI and interactive UI,
So that I can customize server behavior, troubleshoot issues, and manage configurations efficiently with real-time validation.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [ ] Review MCP server configuration file formats and schemas
- [ ] Document standard configuration locations and naming conventions
- [ ] Identify configuration validation and error checking mechanisms
- [ ] Note configuration templating and inheritance patterns
- [ ] Research configuration backup and versioning approaches

### API Documentation Review
- [ ] MCP server configuration schema specifications
- [ ] Configuration file format standards (JSON, YAML, TOML)
- [ ] Server-specific configuration options and parameters
- [ ] Configuration validation rules and constraints
- [ ] Hot-reload and configuration update mechanisms

### Technical Research
- [ ] Review configuration management patterns in similar tools
- [ ] Study configuration validation and schema libraries
- [ ] Performance considerations for configuration parsing
- [ ] Security implications of configuration management
- [ ] Configuration editing and diff visualization approaches

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Display server configurations in human-readable format (CLI & UI)
- [ ] Edit server configurations with syntax validation
- [ ] Validate configuration files against schemas with real-time feedback
- [ ] Create new server configurations from templates
- [ ] Backup and restore server configurations
- [ ] Show configuration diff between versions
- [ ] Export/import configurations for sharing
- [ ] Interactive UI: Configuration viewer with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Interactive UI: Inline editing with real-time validation
- [ ] Interactive UI: Configuration diff viewer with side-by-side comparison
- [ ] Interactive UI: Template selection and creation wizard
- [ ] Performance: Configuration operations complete in <2 seconds

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Configuration syntax highlighting and formatting
- [ ] Comprehensive validation with helpful error messages
- [ ] Safe configuration editing with backup creation
- [ ] Version control integration for configuration tracking
- [ ] No data loss during configuration operations

## Behavioral Specifications

Feature: MCP Server Configuration Management
  As a Claude Code user
  I want to manage MCP server configurations
  So that I can customize and maintain my server infrastructure

  Background:
    Given I have MCP servers with configuration files
    And I am using claude-tools with configuration management

  Scenario: View server configuration
    Given there is a server named "example-server" with configuration
    When I run "claude-tools mcp config show example-server"
    Then I should see the server's configuration
    And the configuration should be syntax highlighted
    And the output should be well-formatted and readable

  Scenario: Edit server configuration
    Given there is a server named "example-server"
    When I run "claude-tools mcp config edit example-server"
    Then the configuration should open in my default editor
    And changes should be validated when saved
    And a backup should be created before editing

  Scenario: Validate configuration file
    Given there is a configuration file with potential errors
    When I run "claude-tools mcp config validate example-server"
    Then the configuration should be checked against the schema
    And any validation errors should be clearly displayed
    And suggestions for fixes should be provided

  Scenario: Create configuration from template
    Given there are available configuration templates
    When I run "claude-tools mcp config new my-server --template basic"
    Then a new configuration should be created from the template
    And the configuration should be valid and ready to use
    And template placeholders should be populated with defaults

  Scenario: Show configuration differences
    Given there is a server with configuration history
    When I run "claude-tools mcp config diff example-server --previous"
    Then I should see a diff of configuration changes
    And additions should be highlighted in green
    And deletions should be highlighted in red
    And the diff should be easy to read and understand

  Scenario: Backup and restore configuration
    Given there is a server named "example-server"
    When I run "claude-tools mcp config backup example-server"
    Then a backup should be created with timestamp
    And I should be able to restore from the backup later
    And the backup should include all configuration files

  Scenario: Export configuration for sharing
    Given there is a properly configured server
    When I run "claude-tools mcp config export example-server --output config.json"
    Then the configuration should be exported to the specified file
    And sensitive information should be redacted or encrypted
    And the exported file should be importable on another system

  Scenario: Handle configuration validation errors
    Given there is a configuration file with syntax errors
    When I run configuration validation
    Then specific error messages should be shown
    And line numbers and error locations should be indicated
    And suggestions for fixes should be provided
    And the operation should not break the existing configuration
```
