## User Story
As a Claude Code user working on similar problems across multiple sessions,
I want to compare conversations side-by-side and analyze differences between approaches,
So that I can learn from previous solutions and track evolution of my problem-solving strategies.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [x] Review existing conversation display and navigation
- [ ] Analyze conversation data structure for comparison
- [ ] Document current search and filtering capabilities
- [ ] Identify metadata suitable for comparison
- [ ] Note terminal UI constraints for side-by-side display

### API Documentation Review
- [ ] Conversation message structure and content formats
- [ ] Tool usage patterns across conversations

## Behavioral Specifications

```gherkin
Feature: Multi-Session Comparison Tools
  As a user with multiple related conversations
  I want to compare conversations and analyze differences
  So that I can learn from previous approaches and track problem-solving evolution

  Background:
    Given I have multiple conversations about similar topics
    And I am using claude-tools with comparison capability

  Scenario: Compare two conversations side-by-side
    Given I have conversations "abc123" and "def456"
    When I run "claude-tools compare abc123 def456"
    Then I should see both conversations displayed side-by-side
    And I should see highlighted similarities and differences
    And I should see metadata comparison at the top

  Scenario: Find similar conversations
    Given I have a conversation about "rust error handling"
    When I run "claude-tools similar abc123 --limit 5"
    Then I should see conversations ranked by similarity
    And I should see similarity scores and reasons
    And I should be able to compare with any similar conversation

  Scenario: Interactive comparison mode
    Given I am in the interactive terminal mode
    When I select a conversation and press 'c'
    Then I should enter comparison mode
    And I should be able to select a second conversation
    And I should see side-by-side comparison view

  Scenario: Comparison with filtering
    Given I want to compare specific aspects of conversations
    When I run "claude-tools compare abc123 def456 --focus tools"
    Then I should see tool usage comparison specifically
    And other conversation content should be de-emphasized
    And I should see tool effectiveness analysis

  Scenario: Export comparison report
    Given I have compared two conversations
    When I run "claude-tools compare abc123 def456 --export html"
    Then I should get an HTML report with comparison details
    And the report should include similarity analysis
    And it should highlight key differences and patterns

  Scenario: Conversation evolution tracking
    Given I have multiple conversations on the same project
    When I run "claude-tools evolution --project myapp"
    Then I should see conversation timeline
    And I should see how approaches evolved over time
    And I should see pattern changes and improvements

  Scenario: Bulk similarity analysis
    Given I have many conversations in my history
    When I run "claude-tools analyze-patterns --all"
    Then I should see common patterns across conversations
    And I should see recurring problems and solutions
    And I should get insights about my usage patterns
```
