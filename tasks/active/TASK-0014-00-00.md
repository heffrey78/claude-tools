**Assignee**: jeffwikstrom
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)
**Parent Task**: Phase 3 - MCP Server Management
**Dependencies**: TASK-0013-00-00
**Estimated Effort**: L (3d)

## User Story
As a Claude Code user managing MCP servers,
I want to start, stop, and restart MCP servers from the command line,
So that I can control server lifecycle without manual process management.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [ ] Review MCP server startup and shutdown procedures
- [ ] Document server process management patterns
- [ ] Identify server daemon/service integration points
- [ ] Note platform-specific process management differences
- [ ] Research server dependency and startup order requirements

### API Documentation Review
- [ ] MCP server startup configuration and arguments
- [ ] Server shutdown signals and graceful termination
- [ ] Server health check and readiness endpoints
- [ ] Process management best practices for MCP servers
- [ ] Service management integration (systemd, launchd, Windows services)

### Technical Research
- [ ] Review process management libraries in Rust
- [ ] Study server lifecycle patterns in similar ecosystems
- [ ] Performance considerations for server startup/shutdown
- [ ] Security implications of process management
- [ ] Error handling for failed server operations

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Start MCP servers by name or configuration
- [ ] Stop running servers gracefully with timeout
- [ ] Restart servers with configurable delay
- [ ] Show real-time server status during operations
- [ ] Handle server startup failures with detailed error messages
- [ ] Support bulk operations (start/stop multiple servers)
- [ ] Manage server dependencies and startup order
- [ ] Performance: Server operations complete in <10 seconds

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Graceful server shutdown with configurable timeout
- [ ] Proper cleanup of server resources and temporary files
- [ ] Comprehensive logging of server lifecycle events
- [ ] Cross-platform process management compatibility
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities in process handling

## Behavioral Specifications

Feature: MCP Server Lifecycle Management
  As a Claude Code user
  I want to control MCP server lifecycle
  So that I can manage my server infrastructure efficiently

  Background:
    Given I have MCP servers configured on my system
    And I am using claude-tools with server management capabilities

  Scenario: Start a stopped server
    Given there is a server named "example-server" that is stopped
    When I run "claude-tools mcp start example-server"
    Then the server should start successfully
    And the server status should change to "running"
    And I should see a success message with server details

  Scenario: Stop a running server
    Given there is a server named "example-server" that is running
    When I run "claude-tools mcp stop example-server"
    Then the server should stop gracefully
    And the server status should change to "stopped"
    And all server processes should be terminated

  Scenario: Restart a running server
    Given there is a server named "example-server" that is running
    When I run "claude-tools mcp restart example-server"
    Then the server should stop gracefully
    And the server should start again
    And the server status should remain "running"
    And I should see restart completion message

  Scenario: Handle server startup failure
    Given there is a misconfigured server named "broken-server"
    When I run "claude-tools mcp start broken-server"
    Then the start command should fail
    And I should see a detailed error message
    And the server status should remain "stopped"
    And no orphaned processes should remain

  Scenario: Start multiple servers
    Given there are servers "server-a", "server-b", "server-c" that are stopped
    When I run "claude-tools mcp start server-a server-b server-c"
    Then all three servers should start successfully
    And I should see status updates for each server
    And all servers should have "running" status

  Scenario: Force stop unresponsive server
    Given there is an unresponsive server named "stuck-server"
    When I run "claude-tools mcp stop stuck-server --force"
    Then the server should be forcefully terminated
    And all associated processes should be killed
    And the server status should change to "stopped"

  Scenario: Server startup with dependencies
    Given server "dependent-server" requires "base-server" to be running
    When I run "claude-tools mcp start dependent-server"
    Then "base-server" should start first
    And "dependent-server" should start after "base-server" is ready
    And both servers should have "running" status
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Process Management Foundation
1. [ ] Design server lifecycle management architecture
2. [ ] Implement cross-platform process spawning and control
3. [ ] Create server process registry and tracking
4. [ ] Add server health checking and readiness detection
5. [ ] Implement graceful shutdown with timeout handling

### Phase 2: Server Operations
1. [ ] Implement server start functionality with error handling
2. [ ] Add server stop with graceful shutdown and force options
3. [ ] Create server restart with configurable delay
4. [ ] Add bulk operations for multiple servers
5. [ ] Implement dependency resolution and startup ordering

### Phase 3: CLI Integration
1. [ ] Add `start`, `stop`, `restart` subcommands to `mcp` command
2. [ ] Implement real-time status reporting during operations
3. [ ] Add progress indicators and operation feedback
4. [ ] Create force and bulk operation flags
5. [ ] Add comprehensive help and examples

### Phase 4: Error Handling and Reliability
1. [ ] Add robust error handling for all failure scenarios
2. [ ] Implement server process cleanup and resource management
3. [ ] Add operation logging and audit trails
4. [ ] Create recovery mechanisms for failed operations
5. [ ] Add operation timeout and cancellation support
