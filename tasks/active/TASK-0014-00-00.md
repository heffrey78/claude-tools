## User Story
As a Claude Code user managing MCP servers,
I want to start, stop, and restart MCP servers from both CLI and interactive UI,
So that I can control server lifecycle efficiently with real-time feedback and visual status updates.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [ ] Review MCP server startup and shutdown procedures
- [ ] Document server process management patterns
- [ ] Identify server daemon/service integration points
- [ ] Note platform-specific process management differences
- [ ] Research server dependency and startup order requirements

### API Documentation Review
- [ ] MCP server startup configuration and arguments
- [ ] Server shutdown signals and graceful termination
- [ ] Server health check and readiness endpoints
- [ ] Process management best practices for MCP servers
- [ ] Service management integration (systemd, launchd, Windows services)

### Technical Research
- [ ] Review process management libraries in Rust
- [ ] Study server lifecycle patterns in similar ecosystems
- [ ] Performance considerations for server startup/shutdown
- [ ] Security implications of process management
- [ ] Error handling for failed server operations

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Start MCP servers by name or configuration (CLI & UI)
- [ ] Stop running servers gracefully with timeout
- [ ] Restart servers with configurable delay
- [ ] Show real-time server status during operations with visual feedback
- [ ] Handle server startup failures with detailed error messages
- [ ] Support bulk operations (start/stop multiple servers)

- [ ] Interactive UI: Quick action buttons/shortcuts for start/stop/restart
- [ ] Interactive UI: Real-time status indicators during operations
- [ ] Interactive UI: Progress bars and operation feedback

- [ ] Performance: Server operations complete in <10 seconds

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Graceful server shutdown with configurable timeout
- [ ] Proper cleanup of server resources and temporary files
- [ ] Comprehensive logging of server lifecycle events
- [ ] Cross-platform process management compatibility
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities in process handling

## Behavioral Specifications

Feature: MCP Server Lifecycle Management
  As a Claude Code user
  I want to control MCP server lifecycle
  So that I can manage my server infrastructure efficiently

  Background:
    Given I have MCP servers configured on my system
    And I am using claude-tools with server management capabilities

  Scenario: Start a stopped server
    Given there is a server named "example-server" that is stopped
    When I run "claude-tools mcp start example-server"
    Then the server should start successfully
    And the server status should change to "running"
    And I should see a success message with server details

  Scenario: Stop a running server
    Given there is a server named "example-server" that is running
    When I run "claude-tools mcp stop example-server"
    Then the server should stop gracefully
    And the server status should change to "stopped"
    And all server processes should be terminated

  Scenario: Restart a running server
    Given there is a server named "example-server" that is running
    When I run "claude-tools mcp restart example-server"
    Then the server should stop gracefully
    And the server should start again
    And the server status should remain "running"
    And I should see restart completion message

  Scenario: Handle server startup failure
    Given there is a misconfigured server named "broken-server"
    When I run "claude-tools mcp start broken-server"
    Then the start command should fail
    And I should see a detailed error message
    And the server status should remain "stopped"
    And no orphaned processes should remain

  Scenario: Start multiple servers
    Given there are servers "server-a", "server-b", "server-c" that are stopped
    When I run "claude-tools mcp start server-a server-b server-c"
    Then all three servers should start successfully
    And I should see status updates for each server
    And all servers should have "running" status

  Scenario: Force stop unresponsive server
    Given there is an unresponsive server named "stuck-server"
    When I run "claude-tools mcp stop stuck-server --force"
    Then the server should be forcefully terminated
    And all associated processes should be killed
    And the server status should change to "stopped"

  Scenario: Server startup with dependencies
    Given server "dependent-server" requires "base-server" to be running
    When I run "claude-tools mcp start dependent-server"
    Then "base-server" should start first
    And "dependent-server" should start after "base-server" is ready
    And both servers should have "running" status

  Scenario: Interactive UI server control
    Given I am in the interactive server dashboard
    And there is a stopped server selected
    When I press 's' to start the server
    Then I should see a progress indicator
    And the server status should update in real-time
    And I should see a success message when complete

  Scenario: Bulk operations in interactive UI
    Given I am in the interactive server dashboard
    And I have selected multiple stopped servers
    When I press 'S' for bulk start
    Then I should see a confirmation dialog
    And after confirming, all servers should start
    And I should see progress for each server
    And status indicators should update as servers start

  Scenario: Real-time operation feedback
    Given I am starting a server that takes time to initialize
    When I initiate the start operation in interactive UI
    Then I should see a spinner or progress bar
    And status should show "starting..." with visual indicator
    And when complete, status should change to "running" with green indicator
```
