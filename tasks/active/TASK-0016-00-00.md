## Behavioral Specifications

Feature: MCP Server Health Monitoring and Diagnostics
  As a Claude Code user
  I want to monitor and diagnose MCP server health
  So that I can maintain reliable server operations

  Background:
    Given I have MCP servers running on my system
    And I am using claude-tools with health monitoring capabilities

  Scenario: Check server health status
    Given there are running MCP servers
    When I run "claude-tools mcp health"
    Then I should see health status for all servers
    And healthy servers should be marked as "healthy"
    And unhealthy servers should show specific issues
    And response times should be displayed

  Scenario: Perform detailed server diagnostics
    Given there is a server named "example-server"
    When I run "claude-tools mcp diagnose example-server"
    Then I should see comprehensive diagnostic information
    And the diagnostics should include configuration validation
    And performance metrics should be displayed
    And connectivity tests should be performed

  Scenario: Monitor server performance metrics
    Given there is a running server with performance data
    When I run "claude-tools mcp metrics example-server"
    Then I should see CPU and memory usage
    And request rate and response time metrics should be shown
    And error rates and success rates should be displayed
    And metrics should be updated in real-time

  Scenario: Detect server failure
    Given there is a server that becomes unresponsive
    When I run health monitoring
    Then the server should be marked as "unhealthy"
    And specific failure symptoms should be reported
    And suggested remediation actions should be provided
    And the failure should be logged with timestamp

  Scenario: Generate health report
    Given there are multiple servers with health history
    When I run "claude-tools mcp health --report --since 24h"
    Then I should see a comprehensive health report
    And the report should include uptime statistics
    And failure incidents should be summarized
    And performance trends should be highlighted

  Scenario: Set up health alerts
    Given I want to monitor server health continuously
    When I run "claude-tools mcp health --watch --alert"
    Then health monitoring should run continuously
    And alerts should be triggered for health issues
    And I should be notified of critical problems
    And monitoring should not impact server performance

  Scenario: Troubleshoot connectivity issues
    Given there is a server with connection problems
    When I run "claude-tools mcp diagnose example-server --connectivity"
    Then network connectivity should be tested
    And port availability should be checked
    And protocol compatibility should be verified
    And specific connection errors should be reported
```
