## User Story
As a Claude Code user with complex search requirements,
I want advanced search capabilities with regex patterns, complex filters, and query building,
So that I can find specific conversations using sophisticated criteria and pattern matching.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [x] Review existing search functionality (TF-IDF, regex, fuzzy search implemented)
- [ ] Analyze current filter capabilities (date, project filtering)
- [ ] Document search performance characteristics
- [ ] Identify gaps in current search feature set
- [ ] Note areas for search enhancement and optimization

### API Documentation Review
- [ ] Conversation metadata fields available for filtering
- [ ] Message content structure and searchable fields
- [ ] Tool usage data and filterable attributes
- [ ] Model information and search criteria
- [ ] Temporal data and date range filtering options

### Technical Research
- [ ] Advanced regex features and optimization
- [ ] Query parsing and validation libraries
- [ ] Search index optimization techniques
- [ ] Filter combination and boolean logic
- [ ] Performance optimization for complex queries

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Complex boolean search queries (AND, OR, NOT, parentheses)
- [ ] Advanced regex patterns with named groups and lookarounds
- [ ] Date range filtering with relative and absolute dates
- [ ] Model-specific search and filtering
- [ ] Tool usage filtering and pattern matching
- [ ] Message role filtering (user, assistant, system)
- [ ] Project path filtering with wildcards
- [ ] Conversation length and duration filtering
- [ ] Performance: Complex queries return results in <200ms

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Query syntax is intuitive and well-documented
- [ ] Error messages for invalid queries are helpful
- [ ] Search performance scales with conversation count
- [ ] Memory efficient for large result sets
- [ ] Query building interface is user-friendly

Feature: Advanced Search with Regex and Filters
  As a user with sophisticated search requirements
  I want advanced search capabilities with complex filters
  So that I can find specific conversations using precise criteria

  Background:
    Given I have a large collection of conversations
    And I am using claude-tools with advanced search capability

  Scenario: Boolean search queries
    Given I want to find conversations about specific topics
    When I run "claude-tools search '(rust OR python) AND error NOT syntax'"
    Then I should see conversations matching the boolean logic
    And results should be ranked by relevance
    And I should see match highlighting for all terms

  Scenario: Advanced regex patterns
    Given I want to find specific code patterns
    When I run "claude-tools search 'regex:async\s+fn\s+\w+.*->.*Result'"
    Then I should see conversations containing async functions returning Results
    And regex matches should be highlighted
    And I should see context around matches

  Scenario: Date range filtering
    Given I want to filter by conversation dates
    When I run "claude-tools search 'error' --after '2024-01-01' --before 'last week'"
    Then I should see only conversations from that date range
    And date expressions should be parsed flexibly
    And I should see date range in results summary

  Scenario: Model and tool filtering
    Given I want to find conversations using specific models or tools
    When I run "claude-tools search 'debugging' --model 'claude-3' --tool 'bash'"
    Then I should see conversations using Claude-3 with bash tool usage
    And I should see model and tool information in results
    And filtering should be combinable with text search

  Scenario: Complex multi-criteria search
    Given I want very specific search criteria
    When I run "claude-tools search 'performance' --project '*backend*' --duration '>30min' --messages '>50'"
    Then I should see long backend conversations about performance
    And all criteria should be satisfied simultaneously
    And I should see criteria summary in results

  Scenario: Interactive query builder
    Given I am in the interactive terminal mode
    When I press '/' to start search
    Then I should see a query builder interface
    And I should be able to add filters step by step
    And I should see query preview as I build it
    And I should be able to save and reuse complex queries

  Scenario: Search result refinement
    Given I have search results displayed
    When I press 'f' to add filters
    Then I should be able to refine results without re-searching
    And filters should be applied to current results
    And I should see result count updates in real-time

  Scenario: Saved search queries
    Given I have created complex search queries
    When I run "claude-tools search --save-query 'debugging-sessions'"
    Then I should be able to reuse the query later
    And I should be able to list and manage saved queries
    And saved queries should include all filters and criteria
```
