## User Story
As a user with large Claude Code conversation files,
I want to browse and search my conversations without memory issues,
So that I can efficiently work with conversation histories of any size.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [ ] Analyze typical conversation file sizes in ~/.claude/
- [ ] Document JSON structure depth and nesting patterns
- [ ] Identify memory bottlenecks in full-file parsing
- [ ] Research streaming JSON parsing requirements
- [ ] Note specific fields needed for browsing vs. full content

### API Documentation Review
- [ ] Latest conversation JSON schema structure
- [ ] Message format and metadata organization
- [ ] Attachment and media handling in conversations
- [ ] Pagination patterns in conversation data
- [ ] Schema evolution and backward compatibility

### Technical Research
- [ ] Rust streaming JSON libraries: serde_json streaming, json-stream
- [ ] Memory-efficient parsing patterns
- [ ] Lazy loading and pagination strategies
- [ ] Indexing approaches for fast navigation
- [ ] Performance benchmarking methodologies

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Parse JSON files >1GB without loading entire file into memory
- [ ] Extract conversation metadata without full file parsing
- [ ] Support seeking to specific messages/timestamps
- [ ] Handle nested JSON structures efficiently
- [ ] Performance: Parse metadata from 1GB file in <2 seconds
- [ ] Memory: Maximum 50MB RAM usage regardless of file size

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Graceful handling of malformed JSON
- [ ] Progress indication for long operations
- [ ] Cancellable operations for user control
- [ ] Error recovery from partial file corruption

## Behavioral Specifications

```gherkin
Feature: Streaming JSON Processing
  As a user with large conversation files
  I want memory-efficient file processing
  So that I can work with files of any size

  Background:
    Given I have conversation files of various sizes
    And some files are larger than available RAM

  Scenario: Process large file efficiently
    Given I have a 2GB conversation file
    When I request conversation metadata
    Then the metadata should be extracted in <5 seconds
    And memory usage should not exceed 50MB
    And I should see progress indication

  Scenario: Seek to specific conversation point
    Given I have a large conversation file
    When I request messages from a specific timestamp
    Then the tool should seek to that position efficiently
    And should not parse the entire file
    And should return results in <1 second

  Scenario: Handle corrupted JSON gracefully
    Given I have a partially corrupted conversation file
    When I attempt to parse the file
    Then valid portions should be processed successfully
    And corrupted sections should be logged as warnings
    And parsing should continue with remaining content

  Scenario: Progress feedback for long operations
    Given I have a very large conversation file
    When I initiate parsing operations
    Then I should see progress updates every second
    And I should be able to cancel the operation
    And cancellation should be immediate

  Scenario: Memory efficiency verification
    Given I have multiple large conversation files
    When I process them sequentially
    Then memory usage should remain constant
    And there should be no memory leaks
    And garbage collection should be efficient

  Scenario: Concurrent file processing
    Given I have multiple conversation files to process
    When I process them concurrently
    Then memory usage should scale linearly with thread count
    And total processing time should be reduced
    And system should remain responsive
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup & Research
1. [ ] Research Rust streaming JSON libraries
2. [ ] Create test fixtures with large JSON files
3. [ ] Set up memory profiling and benchmarking tools
4. [ ] Define streaming data structures

### Phase 2: Development
1. [ ] Implement basic streaming JSON parser
2. [ ] Add conversation metadata extraction
3. [ ] Create seeking/navigation functionality
4. [ ] Implement progress tracking and cancellation
5. [ ] Add comprehensive error handling

### Phase 3: Optimization
1. [ ] Profile memory usage and optimize
2. [ ] Implement parallel processing where beneficial
3. [ ] Add caching for frequently accessed data
4. [ ] Optimize for different file size categories

### Phase 4: Integration
1. [ ] Integrate with directory analysis module
2. [ ] Add configuration for memory limits
3. [ ] Create benchmarking and testing suite

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] StreamingParser: Basic JSON streaming functionality
