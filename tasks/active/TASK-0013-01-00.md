**Assignee**: jeffwikstrom
**Priority**: P1 (High)
**Parent Task**: TASK-0013-00-00 (MCP Server Discovery and Listing)
**Dependencies**: None
**Estimated Effort**: L (3d)

## User Story
As a Claude Code user,
I want to manage MCP server configurations in ~/.claude.json,
So that I can add, remove, update, and control MCP servers used by Claude Code.

## Context & Research

### Discovery: Claude Code MCP Configuration Structure
Based on analysis of ~/.claude.json, Claude Code stores MCP configurations in two locations:

1. **Global MCP Servers** (top-level `mcpServers` object):
   - Available across all projects
   - Stored at the root of ~/.claude.json
   - Example: brave-search, sequential-thinking, context7

2. **Project-Specific MCP Servers** (within each project object):
   - Each project has its own `mcpServers` object
   - Project paths are keys under the `projects` object
   - Can override or supplement global servers

### MCP Server Configuration Format
```json
{
  "server-name": {
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "npx",
    "args": [
      "-y",
      "@namespace/server-package"
    ],
    "env": {
      "API_KEY": "optional-api-key"
    }
  }
}
```

### Additional MCP-Related Fields
- `enabledMcpjsonServers`: Array of enabled server IDs
- `disabledMcpjsonServers`: Array of disabled server IDs
- `mcpContextUris`: Array of context URIs for MCP

### File Characteristics
- Large file: 4250+ lines
- Contains sensitive data (API keys)
- JSON format with nested project configurations
- Multiple projects with varying MCP configurations

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Parse and display global MCP servers from ~/.claude.json
- [ ] Parse and display project-specific MCP servers
- [ ] List servers with name, type, command, and status
- [ ] Add new MCP server configurations (global or project-specific)
- [ ] Remove existing MCP server configurations
- [ ] Update server configurations (command, args, env vars)
- [ ] Enable/disable servers without removing configuration
- [ ] Validate server configurations before saving
- [ ] Handle environment variables and API keys securely
- [ ] Backup ~/.claude.json before making changes
- [ ] Support both CLI and interactive UI operations
- [ ] Interactive UI: Visual editor for server configurations
- [ ] Interactive UI: Safe handling of sensitive data (masked API keys)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Preserve all other content in ~/.claude.json unchanged
- [ ] Maintain proper JSON formatting and indentation
- [ ] Atomic file operations (no partial writes)
- [ ] Secure handling of API keys (no logging, masked display)
- [ ] Handle file locks gracefully
- [ ] Performance: Parse and update in <1 second

## Behavioral Specifications

```gherkin
Feature: MCP Server Configuration Management
  As a Claude Code user
  I want to manage MCP servers in ~/.claude.json
  So that I can control which servers are available

  Background:
    Given I have Claude Code installed
    And ~/.claude.json exists with valid configuration

  Scenario: List global MCP servers
    Given there are global MCP servers configured
    When I run "claude-tools mcp list --global"
    Then I should see all global MCP servers
    And each server should show its configuration details
    And API keys should be masked for security

  Scenario: List project-specific MCP servers
    Given I am in a project directory
    And the project has specific MCP servers configured
    When I run "claude-tools mcp list"
    Then I should see both global and project-specific servers
    And project servers should be marked as such

  Scenario: Add a new global MCP server
    Given I want to add a new MCP server globally
    When I run "claude-tools mcp add --global sequential-thinking --command npx --args '-y' '@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking'"
    Then the server should be added to global mcpServers
    And ~/.claude.json should be properly formatted
    And a backup should be created

  Scenario: Remove an MCP server
    Given there is an existing MCP server "test-server"
    When I run "claude-tools mcp remove test-server"
    Then the server should be removed from configuration
    And other configurations should remain unchanged

  Scenario: Update server environment variables
    Given there is a server with API key configuration
    When I run "claude-tools mcp update brave --env BRAVE_API_KEY=new-key"
    Then the environment variable should be updated
    And the old value should be replaced

  Scenario: Interactive UI server management
    Given I am in the interactive UI MCP management screen
    When I select a server and press 'e' to edit
    Then I should see an editor with masked API keys
    And I should be able to modify configuration safely
    And changes should be validated before saving

  Scenario: Handle file conflicts
    Given another process is modifying ~/.claude.json
    When I try to update MCP server configuration
    Then I should see an appropriate error message
    And no changes should be made
    And I should be prompted to retry

  Scenario: Backup and restore
    Given I am making changes to MCP configuration
    When the operation completes successfully
    Then a timestamped backup should exist
    And I should be able to restore from backup if needed
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Configuration Parser
1. [ ] Create ClaudeConfig struct to model ~/.claude.json
2. [ ] Implement JSON parser with serde for configuration
3. [ ] Add methods to extract global and project MCP servers
4. [ ] Create MCP server configuration data structures
5. [ ] Add configuration validation logic

### Phase 2: File Operations
1. [ ] Implement atomic file read/write operations
2. [ ] Add backup functionality before modifications
3. [ ] Create file locking mechanism for concurrent access
4. [ ] Implement configuration merge logic
5. [ ] Add rollback capability on errors

### Phase 3: CLI Commands
1. [ ] Extend `mcp` subcommand with configuration operations
2. [ ] Add `add`, `remove`, `update` subcommands
3. [ ] Implement `--global` and `--project` flags
4. [ ] Add environment variable management
5. [ ] Create configuration validation before save

### Phase 4: Security Features
1. [ ] Implement API key masking for display
2. [ ] Add secure input for sensitive data
3. [ ] Prevent logging of sensitive information
4. [ ] Create encryption option for stored keys
5. [ ] Add audit trail for configuration changes

### Phase 5: Interactive UI
1. [ ] Add configuration management to MCP dashboard
2. [ ] Create visual server configuration editor
3. [ ] Implement form validation and error handling
4. [ ] Add confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
5. [ ] Create backup/restore UI functionality

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] ClaudeConfig: Parsing, serialization, validation
- [ ] McpServerConfig: Configuration structure and methods
- [ ] FileOperations: Atomic writes, backups, locking
- [ ] Security: API key masking, secure storage

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Full configuration read/write cycle
- [ ] Concurrent access handling
- [ ] Backup and restore operations
- [ ] CLI command integration
- [ ] Interactive UI workflows

### E2E Tests
- [ ] Add new server and verify in Claude Code
- [ ] Remove server and confirm removal
- [ ] Update configuration and test functionality
- [ ] Handle large configuration files (performance)
- [ ] Recovery from corrupted configuration

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Can manage MCP servers in ~/.claude.json safely
- [ ] Configuration changes persist correctly
- [ ] API keys and sensitive data handled securely
- [ ] Backup/restore functionality working
- [ ] All tests passing with >80% coverage
- [ ] Documentation updated with configuration format
- [ ] No data loss or corruption possible
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (<1s operations)
- [ ] Interactive UI provides safe editing experience

## Notes
- The ~/.claude.json file is critical for Claude Code operation
- Must ensure zero data loss or corruption
- API keys require special security considerations
- File can be very large (4000+ lines) requiring efficient parsing
- Consider implementing a dry-run mode for testing changes
