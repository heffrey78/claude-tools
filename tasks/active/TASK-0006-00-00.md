## User Story
As a user with many Claude Code conversations,
I want to search and filter my conversations by content, date, and metadata,
So that I can quickly find specific conversations or topics I'm looking for.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [ ] Analyze conversation content structure for search indexing
- [ ] Document searchable fields: content, timestamps, metadata, tool calls
- [ ] Research full-text search requirements and patterns
- [ ] Identify filtering criteria: date ranges, conversation length, participants
- [ ] Note performance requirements for search across large datasets

### API Documentation Review
- [ ] Conversation metadata available for filtering
- [ ] Message content structure and searchable fields
- [ ] Tool call and response content organization
- [ ] Timestamp formats and date filtering capabilities
- [ ] Search result ranking and relevance considerations

### Technical Research
- [ ] Rust search libraries: tantivy, sonic, ripgrep patterns
- [ ] In-memory vs. indexed search trade-offs
- [ ] Regular expression search capabilities
- [ ] Fuzzy search and typo tolerance options
- [ ] Performance optimization for real-time search

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Full-text search across conversation content
- [ ] Date range filtering (last week, month, year, custom ranges)
- [ ] Search within specific conversation or across all conversations
- [ ] Regular expression search support
- [ ] Filter by conversation metadata (model, token count, etc.)
- [ ] Performance: Search results in <500ms for typical queries

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Search highlighting in results and conversation display
- [ ] Incremental search with real-time results
- [ ] Search history and saved queries
- [ ] Memory-efficient search index management

## Behavioral Specifications

```gherkin
Feature: Search and Filtering
  As a user with extensive conversation history
  I want powerful search and filtering capabilities
  So that I can quickly locate specific conversations or content

  Background:
    Given I have multiple conversations with various content
    And I am using the claude-tools browser interface

  Scenario: Basic text search
    Given I am viewing the conversation list
    When I press '/' to open search
    And I type "rust programming" and press Enter
    Then conversations containing "rust programming" should be highlighted
    And search results should be ranked by relevance
    And I should see result count and navigation options

  Scenario: Search within specific conversation
    Given I am viewing a specific conversation
    When I press '/' to search within the conversation
    And I type "error handling"
    Then matching text should be highlighted in the conversation
    And I should be able to navigate between matches with 'n' and 'N'

  Scenario: Date range filtering
    Given I am viewing the conversation list
    When I apply a date filter for "last week"
    Then only conversations from the past week should be displayed
    And the filter should be clearly indicated in the interface
    When I clear the filter
    Then all conversations should be visible again

  Scenario: Advanced search with regex
    Given I am in search mode
    When I enter a regex pattern like "error.*handling"
    Then conversations matching the pattern should be found
    And invalid regex should show helpful error messages

  Scenario: Combined search and filtering
    Given I want to find specific content in recent conversations
    When I apply both date filter and text search
    Then results should match both criteria
    And I should see how many total results match each filter

  Scenario: Search result navigation
    Given I have search results displayed
    When I use 'n' to go to next result
    Then the next matching conversation should be selected
    When I use 'N' to go to previous result
    Then the previous matching conversation should be selected

  Scenario: Search performance with large dataset
    Given I have 1000+ conversations
    When I perform a search query
    Then results should appear in <500ms
    And the interface should remain responsive during search
    And I should see progress indication for longer searches

  Scenario: Incremental search
    Given I am typing in the search box
    When I type each character
    Then results should update in real-time
    And I should see result count update dynamically
    And performance should remain smooth
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup & Research
1. [ ] Research Rust search and indexing libraries
2. [ ] Design search architecture and data structures
3. [ ] Create search index structure for conversations
4. [ ] Plan search UI integration with terminal interface

### Phase 2: Core Development
1. [ ] Implement basic full-text search functionality
2. [ ] Add search index building and management
3. [ ] Create search result ranking and relevance scoring
4. [ ] Implement search highlighting in results

### Phase 3: Enhancement
1. [ ] Add date range and metadata filtering
2. [ ] Implement regular expression search support
3. [ ] Create incremental/real-time search
4. [ ] Add search result navigation controls

### Phase 4: Integration & Polish
1. [ ] Integrate search with terminal UI navigation
2. [ ] Add search history and saved queries
3. [ ] Optimize performance for large datasets
4. [ ] Add comprehensive testing and error handling

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] SearchEngine: Core search functionality and ranking
- [ ] IndexBuilder: Search index creation and updates
- [ ] FilterEngine: Date and metadata filtering logic
