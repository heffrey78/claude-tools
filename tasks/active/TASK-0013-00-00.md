**Assignee**: jeffwikstrom
**Priority**: P2 (Medium)
**Parent Task**: Phase 3 - MCP Server Management
**Dependencies**: None
**Estimated Effort**: L (3d)

## User Story
As a Claude Code user managing multiple MCP servers,
I want to discover and list all available MCP servers on my system,
So that I can see what servers are installed and their current status.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [ ] Review MCP server configuration formats and locations
- [ ] Document standard MCP server installation paths
- [ ] Identify server registry mechanisms (if any)
- [ ] Note platform-specific differences (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [ ] Research MCP server metadata and manifest formats

### API Documentation Review
- [ ] MCP Protocol specification for server discovery
- [ ] Standard server configuration file formats
- [ ] Server capability advertisement mechanisms
- [ ] Server health check and status APIs
- [ ] Common server installation patterns

### Technical Research
- [ ] Review existing MCP server implementations
- [ ] Study server discovery patterns in similar ecosystems
- [ ] Performance considerations for server scanning
- [ ] Security implications of server discovery
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility requirements

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Discover MCP servers from standard installation locations
- [ ] Parse server configuration files to extract metadata
- [ ] Display server list with name, version, status, and capabilities
- [ ] Support filtering servers by status (running, stopped, error)
- [ ] Show server installation paths and configuration files
- [ ] Detect server health and connectivity status
- [ ] Handle missing or corrupted server configurations gracefully
- [ ] Performance: Discovery completes in <5 seconds for 50+ servers

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Code follows project style guide
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and logging
- [ ] Tests achieve >80% coverage
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities in server scanning

Feature: MCP Server Discovery and Listing
  As a Claude Code user
  I want to discover and list MCP servers
  So that I can manage my server ecosystem

  Background:
    Given I have MCP servers installed on my system
    And I am using claude-tools with MCP management capabilities

  Scenario: List all discovered servers
    Given there are MCP servers in standard locations
    When I run "claude-tools mcp list"
    Then I should see a list of all discovered servers
    And each server should show name, version, and status
    And the list should be sorted by server name

  Scenario: Show detailed server information
    Given there are MCP servers installed
    When I run "claude-tools mcp list --detailed"
    Then I should see detailed information for each server
    And the details should include installation path
    And the details should include configuration file location
    And the details should include server capabilities

  Scenario: Filter servers by status
    Given there are servers in different states
    When I run "claude-tools mcp list --status running"
    Then I should only see servers that are currently running
    And the count should match the number of running servers

  Scenario: Handle missing server configurations
    Given there is a server with corrupted configuration
    When I run server discovery
    Then the corrupted server should be listed with error status
    And a helpful error message should be displayed
    And other valid servers should still be shown

  Scenario: Cross-platform server discovery
    Given I am on <platform>
    When I run server discovery
    Then servers should be found in platform-appropriate locations
    And configuration parsing should work correctly

    Examples:
      | platform |
      | Windows  |
      | macOS    |
      | Linux    |
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Discovery Foundation
1. [ ] Research MCP server installation patterns and standards
2. [ ] Design server discovery architecture
3. [ ] Create server metadata and configuration data structures
4. [ ] Implement cross-platform path resolution
5. [ ] Create server registry and scanning mechanisms

### Phase 2: Configuration Parsing
1. [ ] Implement server configuration file parsers
2. [ ] Add server capability detection
3. [ ] Create server health check mechanisms
4. [ ] Add server version and metadata extraction
5. [ ] Implement error handling for invalid configurations

### Phase 3: CLI Integration
1. [ ] Add `mcp` subcommand to CLI interface
2. [ ] Implement `list` subcommand with formatting options
3. [ ] Add filtering and sorting capabilities
4. [ ] Create detailed view and status reporting
5. [ ] Add help documentation and examples

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
1. [ ] Create test MCP server configurations
2. [ ] Write unit tests for discovery and parsing
3. [ ] Add integration tests for CLI commands
4. [ ] Test cross-platform compatibility
5. [ ] Performance testing with many servers

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] ServerDiscovery: Configuration parsing, path resolution, error handling
- [ ] ServerRegistry: Server listing, filtering, status detection
- [ ] ConfigParser: Various configuration formats, malformed files
- [ ] PlatformPaths: Cross-platform path resolution

### Integration Tests
- [ ] CLI command integration with discovery engine
- [ ] End-to-end server listing workflows
- [ ] Error handling with real configuration files
- [ ] Performance with large numbers of servers

### E2E Tests
- [ ] User workflow: Discover and list servers from fresh installation
- [ ] User workflow: Filter and search server listings
- [ ] Error scenarios: Missing files, permission issues
- [ ] Performance: Discovery time with 100+ mock servers

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] MCP server discovery works on Windows, macOS, Linux
- [ ] Server listing CLI command implemented and tested
- [ ] All tests passing with >80% coverage
- [ ] Documentation updated with discovery mechanisms
- [ ] No critical or high severity bugs
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (<5s for 50+ servers)
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified
