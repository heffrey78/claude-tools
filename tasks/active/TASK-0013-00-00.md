**Priority**: P2 (Medium)
**Parent Task**: Phase 3 - MCP Server Management
**Dependencies**: None
**Estimated Effort**: L (3d)

## User Story
As a Claude Code user managing multiple MCP servers,
I want to discover and list all available MCP servers both via CLI and interactive UI,
So that I can see what servers are installed, their current status, and manage them efficiently.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [x] Review MCP server configuration formats and locations
  - Claude Code stores MCP servers in ~/.claude.json (not standard MCP locations)
  - Global servers at root level `mcpServers` object
  - Project-specific servers in each project's `mcpServers` object
- [x] Document standard MCP server installation paths
  - NPM packages: @modelcontextprotocol/* namespace
  - Executed via npx with stdio type
- [x] Identify server registry mechanisms (if any)
  - ~/.claude.json serves as the registry for Claude Code
  - enabledMcpjsonServers/disabledMcpjsonServers arrays for state
- [x] Note platform-specific differences (Windows, macOS, Linux)
  - ~/.claude.json location is consistent across platforms
- [x] Research MCP server metadata and manifest formats
  - Configuration includes: type, command, args, env

### API Documentation Review
- [ ] MCP Protocol specification for server discovery
- [ ] Standard server configuration file formats
- [ ] Server capability advertisement mechanisms
- [ ] Server health check and status APIs
- [ ] Common server installation patterns

### Technical Research
- [ ] Review existing MCP server implementations
- [ ] Study server discovery patterns in similar ecosystems
- [ ] Performance considerations for server scanning
- [ ] Security implications of server discovery
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility requirements

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Discover MCP servers from standard installation locations
- [ ] Parse server configuration files to extract metadata
- [ ] Display server list with name, version, status, and capabilities (CLI & UI)
- [ ] Support filtering servers by status (running, stopped, error)
- [ ] Show server installation paths and configuration files
- [ ] Detect server health and connectivity status with visual indicators
- [ ] Handle missing or corrupted server configurations gracefully
- [ ] Interactive UI: Server dashboard with real-time status updates
- [ ] Interactive UI: Server list with vim-style navigation (j/k, search)
- [ ] Interactive UI: Visual status indicators (ðŸŸ¢ running, ðŸ”´ stopped, ðŸŸ¡ warning)
- [ ] Interactive UI: Quick actions accessible via keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] Performance: Discovery completes in <5 seconds for 50+ servers

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Code follows project style guide
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and logging
- [ ] Tests achieve >80% coverage
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities in server scanning

## Behavioral Specifications

Feature: MCP Server Discovery and Listing
  As a Claude Code user
  I want to discover and list MCP servers
  So that I can manage my server ecosystem

  Background:
    Given I have MCP servers installed on my system
    And I am using claude-tools with MCP management capabilities

  Scenario: List all discovered servers
    Given there are MCP servers in standard locations
    When I run "claude-tools mcp list"
    Then I should see a list of all discovered servers
    And each server should show name, version, and status
    And the list should be sorted by server name

  Scenario: Show detailed server information
    Given there are MCP servers installed
    When I run "claude-tools mcp list --detailed"
    Then I should see detailed information for each server
    And the details should include installation path
    And the details should include configuration file location
    And the details should include server capabilities

  Scenario: Filter servers by status
    Given there are servers in different states
    When I run "claude-tools mcp list --status running"
    Then I should only see servers that are currently running
    And the count should match the number of running servers

  Scenario: Handle missing server configurations
    Given there is a server with corrupted configuration
    When I run server discovery
    Then the corrupted server should be listed with error status
    And a helpful error message should be displayed
    And other valid servers should still be shown

  Scenario: Interactive UI server dashboard
    Given I have MCP servers installed
    When I run "claude-tools interactive" and navigate to MCP management
    Then I should see a server dashboard with real-time status
    And servers should have visual status indicators
    And I should be able to navigate with vim-style keys (j/k)
    And I should be able to search servers with '/' key

  Scenario: Quick actions in interactive UI
    Given I am in the interactive server dashboard
    And there is a stopped server selected
    When I press 's' for start action
    Then the server should start
    And the status indicator should update in real-time
    And I should see a success message

  Scenario: Cross-platform server discovery
    Given I am on <platform>
    When I run server discovery (CLI or UI)
    Then servers should be found in platform-appropriate locations
    And configuration parsing should work correctly

    Examples:
      | platform |
      | Windows  |
      | macOS    |
      | Linux    |
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Discovery Foundation
1. [ ] Research MCP server installation patterns and standards

3. [ ] Create server metadata and configuration data structures
4. [ ] Implement cross-platform path resolution
5. [ ] Create server registry and scanning mechanisms

### Phase 2: Configuration Parsing
1. [ ] Implement server configuration file parsers
2. [ ] Add server capability detection
