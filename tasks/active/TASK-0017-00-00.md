**Estimated Effort**: L (3d)

## User Story
As a Claude Code user managing MCP servers,
I want to view and search through server logs from both CLI and an interactive log viewer,
So that I can troubleshoot issues, monitor server activity, and analyze logs efficiently with real-time streaming and advanced filtering.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [ ] Review MCP server logging formats and conventions
- [ ] Document standard log file locations and naming patterns
- [ ] Identify log rotation and retention mechanisms
- [ ] Note structured vs unstructured logging approaches
- [ ] Research log aggregation patterns in server management

### API Documentation Review
- [ ] MCP server logging API specifications and endpoints
- [ ] Standard log format specifications (JSON, structured text)
- [ ] Log level conventions and severity classifications
- [ ] Real-time log streaming capabilities
- [ ] Log filtering and search API endpoints

### Technical Research
- [ ] Review log aggregation and viewing tools (ELK, Loki, etc.)
- [ ] Study log parsing and indexing strategies
- [ ] Performance considerations for large log volumes
- [ ] Security implications of log aggregation
- [ ] Real-time log streaming and tail functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Aggregate logs from multiple MCP servers
- [ ] Display logs with syntax highlighting and formatting (CLI & UI)
- [ ] Search and filter logs by content, level, time range
- [ ] Follow logs in real-time (tail functionality)
- [ ] Parse and display structured log data
- [ ] Export logs for external analysis
- [ ] Handle log rotation and archival automatically
- [ ] Interactive UI: Multi-pane log viewer with server selection
- [ ] Interactive UI: Real-time log streaming with auto-scroll
- [ ] Interactive UI: Advanced search with highlighting and regex
- [ ] Interactive UI: Log level filtering with color coding
- [ ] Interactive UI: Split-view for multiple server logs
- [ ] Performance: Log search completes in <3 seconds for 1M+ entries

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Memory-efficient log processing for large volumes
- [ ] Fast full-text search with indexing
- [ ] Reliable log collection without data loss
- [ ] Secure log access with proper permissions
- [ ] Cross-platform log file handling

## Behavioral Specifications

Feature: MCP Server Log Aggregation and Viewing
  As a Claude Code user
  I want to view and search MCP server logs
  So that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor server activity

  Background:
    Given I have MCP servers generating logs
    And I am using claude-tools with log management capabilities

  Scenario: View recent server logs
    Given there are servers with recent log entries
    When I run "claude-tools mcp logs"
    Then I should see recent log entries from all servers
    And logs should be sorted by timestamp (newest first)
    And each log entry should show server name, level, and message
    And log levels should be color-coded for readability

  Scenario: View logs for specific server
    Given there is a server named "example-server" with logs
    When I run "claude-tools mcp logs example-server"
    Then I should see logs only from that server
    And the logs should include all available log levels
    And timestamps should be clearly displayed

  Scenario: Filter logs by level
    Given there are servers with logs at different levels
    When I run "claude-tools mcp logs --level error"
    Then I should only see error-level log entries
    And the count of filtered entries should be displayed
    And the filtering should work across all servers

  Scenario: Search logs by content
    Given there are servers with log entries containing "connection"
    When I run "claude-tools mcp logs --search connection"
    Then I should see all log entries containing "connection"
    And search terms should be highlighted in the output
    And search should be case-insensitive by default

  Scenario: Follow logs in real-time
    Given there is a server actively generating logs
    When I run "claude-tools mcp logs example-server --follow"
    Then I should see existing recent logs first
    And new log entries should appear as they are written
    And I should be able to exit with Ctrl+C
    And the real-time view should update smoothly

  Scenario: View logs within time range
    Given there are servers with historical log data
    When I run "claude-tools mcp logs --since 1h --until 30m"
    Then I should see logs from 1 hour to 30 minutes ago
    And timestamps should be within the specified range
    And the time range should be clearly indicated

  Scenario: Export logs for analysis
    Given there are servers with log data to export
    When I run "claude-tools mcp logs example-server --export logs.json --since 24h"
    Then logs should be exported to the specified file
    And the export should include all metadata
    And the exported format should be suitable for analysis

  Scenario: Handle large log volumes efficiently
    Given there are servers with millions of log entries
    When I perform log operations
    Then the interface should remain responsive
    And memory usage should stay reasonable
    And search operations should complete quickly
    And pagination should be available for large result sets
```
