## User Story
As a user browsing Claude Code conversations,
I want an intuitive terminal interface with keyboard navigation,
So that I can efficiently explore my conversation history like using less, vim, or other terminal tools.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [ ] Research terminal UI patterns from popular CLI tools
- [ ] Document keyboard shortcuts from less, vim, bat, etc.
- [ ] Analyze terminal compatibility requirements
- [ ] Identify optimal information display patterns
- [ ] Note accessibility considerations for terminal UIs

### API Documentation Review
- [ ] ratatui (formerly tui-rs) latest features and capabilities
- [ ] crossterm compatibility matrix
- [ ] Terminal feature detection and fallbacks
- [ ] Color and styling best practices
- [ ] Performance considerations for terminal rendering

### Technical Research
- [ ] Popular terminal UI libraries: ratatui, cursive, dialoguer
- [ ] Keyboard event handling patterns
- [ ] Terminal size and resize handling
- [ ] Color scheme and accessibility standards
- [ ] Performance optimization for smooth scrolling

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Keyboard navigation: j/k (up/down), g/G (top/bottom), /search, q (quit)
- [ ] Smooth scrolling through conversation lists and content
- [ ] Responsive design for different terminal sizes
- [ ] Visual indicators for current selection and navigation state
- [ ] Performance: <16ms response time for navigation (60fps)
- [ ] Support for mouse wheel scrolling (optional enhancement)

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- [ ] Graceful degradation for limited terminal capabilities
- [ ] Accessible color scheme with high contrast
- [ ] Memory efficient rendering for large conversation lists

## Behavioral Specifications

```gherkin
Feature: Terminal User Interface
  As a user of the claude-tools CLI
  I want intuitive keyboard navigation
  So that I can efficiently browse conversations

  Background:
    Given I have conversations in my ~/.claude/ directory
    And I launch the claude-tools browser interface

  Scenario: Basic navigation controls
    Given I am viewing the conversation list
    When I press 'j' key
    Then the selection should move down one item
    When I press 'k' key
    Then the selection should move up one item
    When I press 'g' key
    Then the selection should jump to the first item
    When I press 'G' key
    Then the selection should jump to the last item

  Scenario: Search functionality
    Given I am viewing the conversation list
    When I press '/' key
    Then a search prompt should appear at the bottom
    When I type search terms and press Enter
    Then conversations matching the search should be highlighted
    When I press 'n' key
    Then the next search result should be selected

  Scenario: Conversation viewing
    Given I have selected a conversation from the list
    When I press Enter or Space
    Then the conversation content should be displayed
    And I should be able to scroll through the conversation
    When I press 'q' or Escape
    Then I should return to the conversation list

  Scenario: Terminal resize handling
    Given I am using the interface
    When I resize my terminal window
    Then the interface should adapt to the new size
    And all content should remain properly formatted
    And navigation state should be preserved

  Scenario: Help system integration
    Given I am using the interface
    When I press '?' or 'h' key
    Then a help overlay should appear
    And should show all available keyboard shortcuts
    When I press any key
    Then the help overlay should disappear

  Scenario: Performance with large lists
    Given I have 1000+ conversations
    When I navigate through the list quickly
    Then each navigation action should respond in <50ms
    And scrolling should be smooth without lag
    And memory usage should remain constant
```
