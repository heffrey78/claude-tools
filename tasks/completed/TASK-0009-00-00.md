## User Story
As a Claude Code user with extensive conversation history,
I want to export my conversations to multiple formats (markdown, PDF, HTML),
So that I can share, archive, or process my conversations outside the terminal interface.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [x] Review existing export functionality (JSON/CSV analytics implemented)
- [ ] Analyze conversation data structure for content export
- [ ] Identify formatting requirements for each target format
- [ ] Document current CLI export capabilities
- [ ] Note performance considerations for large conversation exports

### API Documentation Review
- [ ] Conversation message content structure and formatting
- [ ] Tool usage data and how to represent in exports
- [ ] Timestamp formats and metadata preservation
- [ ] Model information and conversation context
- [ ] File attachment handling (if applicable)

### Technical Research
- [ ] Markdown generation libraries in Rust ecosystem
- [ ] PDF generation options (wkhtmltopdf, headless Chrome, native Rust)
- [ ] HTML templating systems and CSS frameworks
- [ ] Performance optimization for large conversation exports
- [ ] File compression and archiving strategies

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Export single conversations to markdown format
- [ ] Export single conversations to HTML format with styling
- [ ] Export single conversations to PDF format
- [ ] Export multiple conversations as ZIP archive
- [ ] Preserve conversation metadata (timestamps, models, tools)
- [ ] Maintain message formatting and code syntax highlighting
- [ ] Include conversation statistics in exports
- [ ] Support custom export templates
- [ ] Performance: Export 100+ message conversation in <5s

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Generated exports are well-formatted and readable
- [ ] PDF exports are properly paginated
- [ ] HTML exports include responsive CSS
- [ ] Markdown exports follow standard conventions
- [ ] Large exports don't cause memory issues
- [ ] Export progress indication for long operations

Feature: Multi-format Conversation Export
  As a user with conversation history
  I want to export conversations in multiple formats
  So that I can use them outside the terminal interface

  Background:
    Given I have conversations in my Claude directory
    And I am using claude-tools with export capability

  Scenario: Export single conversation to markdown
    Given I have a conversation with ID "abc123"
    When I run "claude-tools show abc123 --export markdown"
    Then I should get a markdown file with conversation content
    And the file should preserve message formatting
    And the file should include metadata headers
    And code blocks should be properly formatted

  Scenario: Export conversation to HTML
    Given I have a conversation with ID "abc123"
    When I run "claude-tools show abc123 --export html"
    Then I should get an HTML file with styled conversation
    And the HTML should include responsive CSS
    And syntax highlighting should be preserved
    And navigation links should be included

  Scenario: Export conversation to PDF
    Given I have a conversation with ID "abc123"
    When I run "claude-tools show abc123 --export pdf"
    Then I should get a PDF file with conversation content
    And the PDF should be properly paginated
    And formatting should be preserved
    And metadata should be included in headers/footers

  Scenario: Export multiple conversations as archive
    Given I have multiple conversations matching a search
    When I run "claude-tools export --format zip --search 'rust code'"
    Then I should get a ZIP file containing all matching conversations
    And each conversation should be in markdown format
    And an index file should list all conversations
    And metadata should be preserved for each conversation

  Scenario: Export with custom template
    Given I have a custom export template file
    When I run "claude-tools show abc123 --export html --template custom.html"
    Then the export should use my custom template
    And conversation data should be properly injected
    And the resulting file should match my template structure

  Scenario: Export large conversation efficiently
    Given I have a conversation with 500+ messages
    When I export it to any format
    Then the export should complete within 10 seconds
    And memory usage should remain reasonable
    And progress should be indicated during export
```
