## User Story
As a user reviewing Claude Code conversations,
I want to see conversations in a clear, readable format,
So that I can easily understand the context, flow, and content of my interactions with Claude.

## Context & Research

### Current State Analysis
- [ ] Analyze Claude Code conversation JSON structure and message format
- [ ] Document message types: user, assistant, system, tool calls, etc.
- [ ] Identify formatting challenges: code blocks, markdown, tool outputs
- [ ] Research conversation metadata: timestamps, tokens, model info
- [ ] Note accessibility requirements for terminal display

### API Documentation Review
- [ ] Latest Claude Code message format specifications
- [ ] Tool calling and response format structures
- [ ] Markdown and code formatting in messages
- [ ] Attachment and media handling patterns
- [ ] Conversation metadata and session information

### Technical Research
- [ ] Terminal markdown rendering libraries: termimad, syntect
- [ ] Code syntax highlighting for terminal: bat, syntect
- [ ] Text wrapping and formatting algorithms
- [ ] Color schemes for readability and accessibility
- [ ] Performance considerations for large conversations

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Display conversations with clear speaker identification (User/Claude)
- [ ] Render markdown formatting: headers, lists, code blocks, emphasis
- [ ] Syntax highlighting for code in multiple languages
- [ ] Show conversation metadata: date, model, token usage
- [ ] Handle tool calls and responses with clear formatting
- [ ] Performance: Render conversation page in <100ms

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] Readable in both light and dark terminal themes
- [ ] Proper text wrapping for different terminal widths
- [ ] Accessible color contrast ratios
- [ ] Memory efficient rendering for long conversations

Feature: Conversation Display
  As a user viewing Claude Code conversations
  I want clear, formatted conversation display
  So that I can easily read and understand my interactions

  Background:
    Given I have selected a conversation to view
    And the conversation contains various message types

  Scenario: Basic conversation rendering
    Given I view a conversation with user and assistant messages
    Then I should see clear visual separation between speakers
    And each message should show timestamp information
    And user messages should be visually distinct from assistant messages

  Scenario: Markdown formatting support
    Given a conversation contains markdown content
    When I view the conversation
    Then headers should be properly formatted and emphasized
    And lists should be properly indented and bulleted
    And emphasis (bold/italic) should be visually distinct
    And links should be highlighted but not clickable

  Scenario: Code block rendering
    Given a conversation contains code blocks
    When I view the conversation
    Then code blocks should be clearly separated from text
    And syntax highlighting should be applied based on language
    And code should preserve original formatting and indentation
    And code blocks should be scrollable if longer than terminal

  Scenario: Tool call display
    Given a conversation contains tool calls and responses
    When I view the conversation
    Then tool calls should be clearly marked and formatted
    And tool responses should be visually distinct
    And tool metadata should be displayed (tool name, parameters)
    And large tool outputs should be truncated with expand option

  Scenario: Terminal width adaptation
    Given I am viewing a conversation
    When I resize my terminal to different widths
    Then text should wrap appropriately to the new width
    And formatting should remain consistent
    And code blocks should adapt or scroll horizontally

  Scenario: Conversation metadata display
    Given I am viewing a conversation
    Then I should see conversation start time and duration
    And I should see model information (Claude version)
    And I should see token usage statistics
    And I should see conversation title if available

  Scenario: Performance with long conversations
    Given I have a conversation with 1000+ messages
    When I view different sections of the conversation
    Then each section should render in <100ms
    And scrolling should be smooth and responsive
    And memory usage should remain constant
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Setup & Research
1. [ ] Research terminal markdown rendering libraries
2. [ ] Analyze conversation JSON structure thoroughly
3. [ ] Design message display format and layout
4. [ ] Set up syntax highlighting dependencies

### Phase 2: Core Development
1. [ ] Implement basic message display structure
2. [ ] Add speaker identification and formatting
3. [ ] Create markdown rendering pipeline
4. [ ] Implement code syntax highlighting
5. [ ] Add timestamp and metadata display

### Phase 3: Enhancement
1. [ ] Implement tool call/response formatting
2. [ ] Add conversation metadata display
3. [ ] Create responsive text wrapping
4. [ ] Optimize performance for long conversations

### Phase 4: Polish & Integration
1. [ ] Add color schemes and accessibility features
2. [ ] Implement truncation and expansion for large content
3. [ ] Integrate with terminal UI navigation
4. [ ] Add comprehensive testing and optimization

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] MessageRenderer: Individual message formatting
- [ ] MarkdownProcessor: Markdown to terminal conversion
- [ ] SyntaxHighlighter: Code highlighting accuracy
- [ ] MetadataExtractor: Conversation metadata display
- [ ] TextWrapper: Responsive text wrapping logic

### Integration Tests
- [ ] End-to-end conversation rendering
- [ ] Terminal width responsiveness testing
- [ ] Performance testing with large conversations
- [ ] Color scheme and accessibility validation

### E2E Tests
- [ ] User workflow: View conversation with mixed content
- [ ] User workflow: Navigate through long conversation
- [ ] User workflow: Resize terminal while viewing
- [ ] Performance: Large conversation rendering
- [ ] Accessibility: High contrast and readability

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Conversation rendering <100ms for typical content
- [ ] Markdown and code highlighting working correctly
- [ ] All message types properly formatted and distinct
- [ ] Terminal width responsiveness working
