Feature: Conversation Statistics and Analytics
  As a power user with extensive conversation history
  I want comprehensive analytics about my Claude usage
  So that I can understand patterns and optimize my workflows

  Background:
    Given I have multiple conversations with various models and tools
    And I am using claude-tools with analytics capability

  Scenario: View global conversation statistics
    Given I run "claude-tools stats --global"
    Then I should see total conversation count
    And I should see total message count by role
    And I should see unique model usage statistics
    And I should see time range of conversations
    And I should see average conversation length

  Scenario: View temporal usage patterns
    Given I access the analytics dashboard
    When I view temporal analytics
    Then I should see conversations per day/week/month
    And I should see usage heat map by time of day
    And I should see productivity trends over time
    And I should see peak usage periods

  Scenario: Analyze model usage patterns
    Given I have conversations using different Claude models
    When I view model analytics
    Then I should see usage frequency per model
    And I should see average conversation length per model
    And I should see success/completion rates per model
    And I should see tool usage patterns per model

  Scenario: Project-based analytics
    Given I have conversations across multiple projects
    When I filter analytics by project
    Then I should see per-project conversation counts
    And I should see project-specific model usage
    And I should see project activity timelines
    And I should see cross-project comparisons

  Scenario: Tool usage analytics
    Given I have conversations with tool usage
    When I view tool analytics
    Then I should see most frequently used tools
    And I should see tool success rates
    And I should see tools per conversation statistics
    And I should see tool usage trends over time

  Scenario: Interactive analytics dashboard
    Given I run "claude-tools interactive"
    When I access the analytics view with "a" key
    Then I should see a scrollable analytics dashboard
    And I should be able to navigate between metric categories
    And I should see visual representations where appropriate
    And I should be able to export data with "e" key

  Scenario: Export analytics data
    Given I have analytics computed
    When I export with "claude-tools stats --export csv"
    Then I should get a CSV file with all metrics
    And the CSV should be importable into spreadsheet software
    And I should be able to export to JSON format
    And exported data should include timestamps and metadata

  Scenario: Performance with large datasets
    Given I have 1000+ conversations
    When I generate analytics
    Then results should appear within 2 seconds
    And the system should remain responsive
    And memory usage should stay under 100MB
    And I should see progress indication for longer operations
```
